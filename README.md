        <p class="paragraphtext">I join GDSC for finding new experience because i think GDSC is the most
             <span class="mark-text">interest</span> in my opinion. I aim working as 
             <span class="mark-text">Network Security Administrator and Cyber Security</span>.Because i like this way.
             Before i try Game Developing but i think isn't my way so i choose this way
             .This path is very challenge for me because i think <span class="mark-text">reponsiblity and Awareness</span>  
             is very important as knowledge like playing chess and know your enemy move while you develop your pieces

            Before we reach our goal, we must prepare our skill. First i search on internet and find some lecture that write about path career
            because i need some directing. Second i should practice linux because <span class="mark-text">99% computer server use linux</span> so 
            i practice my linux skill on <span class="mark-text">HACK THE BOX</span> (I'm not finish yet) and practice coding skill on <span class="mark-text">leetcode.</span> 
            Websites that challenge you to solve thier problem with coding skill(i finish only 12 question lol)
